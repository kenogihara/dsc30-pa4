# Starter Code Repository for DSC30 FA23

Every week (most likely on Monday) the starter code for the new PA is published here, under the folder `PA${X}`.

We recommend you clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone ...` and set it aside (to only keep the starter code skeleton) from the individual PA repos you would have for each PA.

To retrieve the latest PA starter code, `cd` into this starter code repo (`cd fa23-startercode`), and run `git pull` so all changes we post to this repo are reflected to your local clones.

## Start Early and Best of Luck
